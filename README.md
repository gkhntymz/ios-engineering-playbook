# iOS Engineering Playbook

A production-grade operating model for building, scaling, and leading high-performance iOS teams.

This repository documents how to design engineering systems — not just write features.

---

# Why this repository exists

Most repositories demonstrate *how to build features*.

Few demonstrate how to:

- Scale engineering teams
- Govern architecture decisions
- Prevent production incidents
- Reduce technical entropy
- Build resilient delivery systems

This repository captures the **operating system behind strong iOS teams**.

---

# Philosophy

Engineering maturity is not measured by:

- Lines of code
- Velocity
- Feature count

It is measured by:

- Decision clarity
- Production stability
- Observability
- Recovery speed
- Organizational resilience

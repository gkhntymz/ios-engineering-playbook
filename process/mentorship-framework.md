# Mentorship Framework

## Why this document exists

High-performing engineering teams are built, not hired.

Mentorship is not optional.
It is a system that compounds team capability over time.

This document defines how mentorship works in our iOS engineering team.

---

# 1. Mentorship Philosophy

Mentorship is:

- Teaching how to think, not what to type
- Reducing long-term dependency
- Scaling engineering judgment
- Creating future mentors

The goal is not to create followers.
The goal is to create independent engineers.

# 2. Types of Mentorship

## A. Technical Mentorship
Focus:
- Architecture reasoning
- Debugging strategy
- Concurrency correctness
- Performance thinking
- Trade-off analysis

## B. Process Mentorship
Focus:
- Writing good PRs
- Documenting decisions (ADR)
- Communicating trade-offs
- Participating in reviews

## C. Leadership Mentorship
Focus:
- Ownership
- Initiative
- Risk awareness
- Product thinking
- Influence without authority

# 3. Mentorship Structure

Mentorship is structured, not ad-hoc.

Each mentee should have:

- A primary mentor
- Bi-weekly 1:1 sessions
- Clear growth goals
- Measurable skill progression

---

# 4. 1:1 Session Format

Each session follows:

1. Wins & blockers
2. Code review discussion
3. Architecture or debugging deep dive
4. Growth reflection
5. Action items

Mentorship is active, not passive.

---

# 5. What Mentors Do NOT Do

Mentors do not:

- Fix code silently
- Take over tasks
- Shield mentee from failure
- Solve problems instantly

Instead they:

- Ask guiding questions
- Encourage independent thinking
- Let mentees struggle productively

---

# 6. Skill Progression Model

Engineers progress across dimensions:

## Code Quality
- Writes clean code
- Understands patterns
- Avoids duplication

## Concurrency & Safety
- Understands isolation
- Avoids race conditions
- Applies cancellation correctly

## Architecture
- Respects module boundaries
- Understands layering
- Anticipates scale

## Production Awareness
- Uses logging intentionally
- Understands monitoring
- Thinks about rollback & risk

Mentorship tracks progress across these axes.

---

# 7. Feedback Model

We use:

- Direct feedback
- Timely feedback
- Evidence-based feedback

Avoid:
- Vague praise
- Emotional criticism
- Delayed evaluation

Example:
Instead of: “This is messy”
Say: “This view model now handles navigation logic. That breaks separation of concerns.”

---

# 8. Shadow → Lead Model

Growth path:

1. Shadow
   - Observe senior decisions
2. Co-own
   - Pair on architecture decisions
3. Lead with supervision
   - Propose ADRs
4. Fully lead
   - Own feature/system area

This creates engineering multipliers.

---

# 9. Measuring Mentorship Effectiveness

Mentorship works if:

- PR quality improves
- Fewer regressions occur
- Engineers propose architectural improvements
- Knowledge silos decrease
- Team velocity increases sustainably

Mentorship is measurable.

---

# 10. Scaling Mentorship

When team grows:

- Seniors mentor mid-level engineers
- Mid-level engineers mentor juniors
- Documentation reduces repetitive teaching
- ADRs reduce decision confusion

This prevents single points of knowledge.

---

# 11. Leadership Perspective

Staff/Principal engineers:

- Design mentorship systems
- Identify talent early
- Prevent burnout
- Protect team culture
- Create future leaders

A team without mentorship stagnates.

A team with structured mentorship compounds.
